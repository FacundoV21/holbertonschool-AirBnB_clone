## Description
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people 
who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. In this project we are going to make a clone of this website. It is going to be divided in parts, the first part being the console.

* The console

The Console is a command-line interface from wich you can create, modify and delete objects in a file storage.
